# leetcode-TownJudge
Town Judge problem from leetcode
Uses a count array to count the level of trustworthiness for every person in the town. If a person is trusted by every one else in town, and they don't trust a single person, then their "trust" count will equal the number of people in town and we will have found our judge. otherwise we return -1 and it remains a mystery.
